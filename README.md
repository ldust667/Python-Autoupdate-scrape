# Python-Autoupdate-scrape
This repository is for the automation of updating a database by scraping a web page for the updated values.
It uses php,python,mysql, and javascript
phpskills is the front end with a search function to compare prices of diffrent models
It's values are pulled from a mysql database.

Python then is intended to auto update the sql database based on values from the games workshop website 

I have added user agents, pauses to the code, tried scrapy, beautiful soup, tried html read. The python scripts here   
pythonscrapetest and Update Price sucessfully can read websites and parse the information easily but will not 
work for the intended gamesworkshop website. My scraper is obeying the robots.txt of the website however
it is presented with a captcha when reading from games workshop. The company has responded and advised they have numerous counter messaures against scraping. With that said, this project will be paused even possibly canceled. The orginal intent of this project will not work but seems to be sucessful with most sites.
